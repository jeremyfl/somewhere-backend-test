## Setup

```bash
adonis install @adonisjs/vow
```

Read setup [instructions](instructions.md)

## Concepts

The test runner is bare bones that you need to setup and run tests using your command line. But it comes with a powerful concept of traits.

### Traits

Traits are building blocks for your tests. Features like **Database transactions**, **Api client**, **Browser client**, they all are built on top of the API provided by traits.

```js
const { trait } = use('Test/Suite')('Sample test suite')

trait((suiteInstance) => {
})
```

### Suite
A test suite is a combination of tests that you want to group inside a single file or group them logically.

Each suite has it's own set of traits, which means adding traits for a single suite, doesn't collides with the other suite :)

### Hooks
Each suite has a lifecycle and you can hook into that lifecycle by adding methods to one of the following events.

```js
const suite = use('Test/Suite')('Sample test suite') 

suite.before(() => {
 // executed before the suite
})

suite.after(() => {
 // executed after the suite
})

suite.beforeEach(() => {
 // executed before each test
})

suite.afterEach(() => {
 // executed after each test
})
```

### Context

Each test suite has a context, which is instantiated and passed to each test, so this is the right place to hook stuff that you want to be available to tests.

```js
const { trait, test } = use('Test/Suite')('Sample test suite')

trait((suite) => {
  suite.Context.getter('foo', () => 'bar')
})


test('foo is bar', (ctx) => {
  ctx.assert(ctx.foo, 'bar')
})

// using es6 destructuring
test('foo is bar', ({ foo, assert }) => {
  assert(foo, 'bar')
})
```


### Development

The tests for the test runner are written using [japa](https://github.com/thetutlage/japa) and make sure to go through the docs.
